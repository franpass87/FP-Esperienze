# Phase 7 â€“ Refactoring Summary

## Overview
- Introduced a reusable `ServiceBooter` utility to declaratively bootstrap plugin services, collapsing ad-hoc instantiation logic inside the main `Plugin` class.
- Reorganised the plugin lifecycle so admin, frontend, and REST hooks are registered through a single `registerLifecycleHooks()` helper, improving readability and easing future maintenance.
- Hardened push-token and feature demo bootstrapping with dedicated helpers and idempotent guards, eliminating duplicated conditional logic.

## Risk & Mitigation
- The refactor centralises service registration which could hide instantiation errors. Guard rails were added via `logServiceErrors()` and contextual logging inside the booter to surface failures without breaking execution.
- Critical components such as the Experience product type still fail gracefully: the booter captures the throwable, surfaces a friendly admin notice, and logs the underlying root cause for debugging.

## Next Steps
- Phase 8 will focus on automated testing and CI coverage; the new boot infrastructure can be leveraged to mock services during unit tests.
